libtorsocks: Got connection request
libtorsocks: connect: Connection is to a local address (192.168.1.1) on non-DNS port, may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server on a non-standard port, so have to reject to be safe. If you would like to allow this connection to happen, you may use the local_connect_enable option in the torsocks config file. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks.
